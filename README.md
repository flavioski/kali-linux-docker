Kali-Linux(LXDE)-Docker image with VNC
=========================

Docker image with **HTML5** VNC interface access to Kali-Linux container LXDE desktop environment.

Quick Start
-------------------------
This Kali Linux Docker image provides a minimal base install of the latest version of the Kali Linux Rolling Distribution. 
There are no tools added to this image, so you will need to install them yourself. For details about Kali Linux metapackages, 
check https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-metapackages/

Before building, check the Dockerfile to uncomment or add needed Kali Linux Metapackages

Build the image
```
docker build -t kali-docker .
```

Run the docker image and open port `6080`

```
docker run -it -d --rm -p 6080:80 kali-docker
```

Browse http://127.0.0.1:6080/


Connect with VNC Viewer and protect by VNC Password
------------------

Forward VNC service port 5900 to host by

```
docker run -it --rm -p 6080:80 -p 5900:5900 kali-docker
```

Now, open the vnc viewer and connect to port 5900. If you would like to protect vnc service by password, set environment variable `VNC_PASSWORD`, for example

```
docker run -it --rm -p 6080:80 -p 5900:5900 -e VNC_PASSWORD=mypassword kali-docker
```

A prompt will ask password either in the browser or vnc viewer.

To get into bash of the running container
```
sudo docker exec -i -t kali-docker /bin/bash
```

P.S. If you are going to run container in cloud virtual machine, first run the bellow command to virtual machine in cloud to create ssh tunnel 
to your virtual machine
```
ssh -i .ssh/private_key -L 6080:localhost:6080 -L 5900:localhost:5900 user@IP
```
